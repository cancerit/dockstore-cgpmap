## Structure

This area reflects the structure of the examples tree.

See [`examples/README.md`](../examples/README.md) for correlation to json param files.

### Files of 1 byte

We include all files in this area but those that are not considered useful for verification
purposes have been truncated to a size of 1 (newline char only).

## How to verify results

### cgpwgs

The following files are to be used to compare results:

* `*.bas` - Statistics of BAM/CRAM generated by `bam_stats`, tsv file.
* `*.met` - Statistics and histogram generated by `bammarkduplicates2`.

A simple diff should be sufficient to verify.

## Why not a tar.gz file?

1. It's easier to see what files should be found in the result archive.
1. We truncate many of the files that don't aid in verification.

## maptime files

These are retained to allow us to look back over the runtimes for the test sets.  Unfortunately
the tool generating these creates files that git doesn't like.

When committing new versions of `*.maptime` files you will see the following error:

```
expected/....maptime:9: new blank line at EOF.
```

To correct these files a quick script is included so you can just run the following from the base
of the project:

```
find . -type file -iname \*.maptime -exec ./scripts/timeCleaner.pl {} \;
```
